* Modern main menu
* Credits graphics specific to the Mimiga Mask ending
* Localization support
* Force feedback support
* Custom soundtrack support
* Initial mod support
* Vita/Switch versions
* Cleaner and partly-refactored code
* Tons of gameplay-related bugfixes
* Removed built-in data extractor
* Removed replays, as they were buggy/not implemented anyway
